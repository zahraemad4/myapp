class -class and instance method
class give functionality to the whole class,while instance method give functionality to just one object

the form of the class is
def self.(class_name)
while the form for instance is
def (oblect_name)

examples:

-class for the users,it will contain all the informations of them and we can use the class methods to access them.
while in instance we can only access one object in the user class like the username.

-also if we have class for books it will contain all the books we have,but if we want use access on a specifc book we will do instance method.

-another example from real life, let's say we have home of 5 rooms
the whole home is a class
while if we want say the first room is empty,this will be instance method
