class -class and instance method
class give functionality to the whole class,while instance method give functionality to just one object

the form of the class is
def self.(class_name)
while the form for instance is
def (oblect_name)

examples:

-class for the users,it will contain all the informations of them and we can use the class methods to access them.
while in instance we can only access one object in the user class like the username.
in terminal:
User.all (is a class method)
in instance first we create method
def user_name
        username
    end

then in terminal we do reload and add this line
User.first.user_name

output:
  User Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> "zahra99"

-also if we have class for books it will contain all the books we have,but if we want use access on a specifc book we will do instance method.
User.all.books (this class method)

User.first.book.title(this consider as instance method)
or we can create new method:

def book_title 
        username + title
     end
in terminal:
 User.first.book_title

-another example from real life, let's ggsay we have home of 5 rooms
the whole home is a class
while if we want say the first room is empty,this will be instance method.
